Sustaining my family needs is my motivation in joining the open house of Zuitt. I really wanted to change career since progress in my field is very slow and deals with company politics.

I am a Mechanical Engineer specializing in Metal Fabrication and Computer Aided Design Drafting. Most of my experience revolves in handling people and monitoring the progress of every projects assigned to my department. There are times when we have few loads, I am assigned as a Research and Development Engineer to seek for information and technology to integrate to our current work process. That's where I find that coding and other IT topics greatly enhances procedure in a wonderful manner, making me more interested in its potential and bright future it may bring to my specialization.
